# DynamicSFM

Contains a c++ file which requires OpenCV 3.1 and OpenCV contrib, and returns the matches and weights of SIFT features of the input images.

Matlab file requires: https://bitbucket.org/ChrisRussell/overlapping-models-public-rep to run. Matlab then segments the features into the corresponding fundamental matrices.
